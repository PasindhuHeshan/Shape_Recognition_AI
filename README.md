# Shape Recognition AI

## 📌 Overview
Shape Recognition AI is a deep learning project that classifies geometric shapes from images. 
It uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) implemented in TensorFlow/Keras to train on a dataset of labeled shapes, evaluate model accuracy, and make predictions.

## 🚀 Features
- Load and preprocess image datasets
- CNN architecture with convolution, pooling, and dense layers
- Model training with validation split
- Evaluation on test data
- Prediction on new images

## 📂 Project Structure
- **Shape_Recognition_AI.ipynb** - Main Jupyter Notebook containing the code and workflow
